# Employee Help Desk

 In an Organization, helpdesk team looks into the queries raised by employees, assigns it to a field agent and updates back the resolution status to the employee. All the queries are logged in as tickets for easy tracking and resolution. A ticketing system enables helpdesk agents to systematically capture, categorize, resolve and collect feedback. This enables an organization to be effective in issue resolution and has a multiplier effect on employee satisfaction scores.

This solution uses Kaizala as the front-end, SharePoint as the backend and Flow as a means to interact with Kaizala and SharePoint. A user creates the ticket by submitting a form in Kaizala, ticket details submitted using this card is captured and stored in the SharePoint using Flow.

On submission, User gets an updated card, either when-
   1. Help desk agent updates the status of the ticket in SharePoint (New, Assigned or Resolved) or

   2. Help desk agents addscomments on the ticket in SharePoint or 

   3. Both, help desk agent updates status and adds comments in SharePoint

If the user is satisfied with the proposed resolution, user has the ability to close the ticket and submit feedback. If the user is not satisfied with the resolution, user can re-open the ticket. User Feedback - Rating and comments, status- Reopened or closed is updated back in SharePoint.

> Note: This card works only in Hub and spoke groups
