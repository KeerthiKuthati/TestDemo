# Employee Help Desk

Employees contact helpdesk with questions or issues. Helpdesk teams look into the issue, assigns it to the right field agent and updates the resolution status to the end user. All the queries are logged in as tickets by organizations for easy tracking and resolution. A ticketing systems enables help desk agents to systematically capture, categorize, resolve and collect feedback. This enables an organization to be organized, effective and effective which has a direct impact on employee satisfaction scores.

This solution uses Kaizala as the front-end, SharePoint as the backend and Flow as a means to interact with Kaizala and SharePoint. When the Help desk agent manages the SharePoint list to update status or adds comment to the ticket, the solution keeps the user updated. It also allows the user to share feedback and  reopen the ticket if required.

## Implementation Steps:
This is broadly divided into 3 steps:
1. Upload action packages
2. Set up a SharePoint list
3. Configure Microsoft Flow

### Upload Action Packages
1. Download the ["EmployeeHelpDesk-SolutionPackage.zip"](Placeholder for Github link) (*This contains 2 action packages and 3 Flows*)
2. Download the latest version of Kaizala ["ActionSDK.Zip"](https://manage.kaiza.la/MiniApps/DownloadSDK) (*This contains KASClient.js*)
3. Set up the "CreateTicket-ActionPackage.Zip"
    1. Unzip "CreateTicket-ActionPackage.Zip" to a folder
   2. Change the action "id" and "provider name" in package.json
   3. Add KASClient.js to this folder 
   4. Zip all the contents in this folder (*This folder is your modified action package which should be imported to Kaizala Management Portal*)
   5. [Import](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/kaizala/actions/publish#import-kaizala-action) the edited action package to [kaizala Management Portal](https://manage.kaiza.la/)
   6. [Publish](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/kaizala/actions/publish) the action and add the action to a group where you want to add the card
   7. Select user roles as admin and member
4. Set up "ReplyFromHelpDesk-ActionPackage.Zip"

   3. Add KASClient.js to this folder 
   4. Zip all the contents in this folder (*This folder is your modified action package which should be imported to kaizala management portal*)
   5. [Import](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/kaizala/actions/publish#import-kaizala-action) the edited action package to [kaizala management portal](https://manage.kaiza.la/)

 > Note: "CreateTicket-ActionPackage.Zip" is the card that is used to raise a ticket and should be made available to admin and members."ReplyFromHelpDesk-ActionPackage.Zip" is used to show updates to the ticket. Users do not have to see this card in action palette, hence this is only made visible to admin. All the updates are sent automatically using Flow. 

### Set up a SharePoint List
